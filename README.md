# Hello, folx! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I'm Andrew (he/they), a software architect obsessed with designing and building scalable, data-intensive systems. I have extensive expertise in Python, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions. 

I have worked in the industry since 2016 and have experience in various domains, including web, IoT, cloud, DevOps, and machine learning. I have held multiple roles since then, including people manager, project manager, lead engineer, and mentor.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, hiking, mountain biking, and building full-stack web applications with my partner @synesdeija
