# Hello, folx! :wave:

I'm Andrew (he/they) 👨‍💻, a Senior Software Engineer and Architect who is passionate about crafting cutting-edge, distributed, scalable, and cloud-native data-intensive systems. 🌐

🚀 My technical expertise spans a broad spectrum, encompassing Python, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Terraform, GCP, and AWS, to name a few. I thrive in diverse paradigms such as web development, IoT, cloud computing, DevOps, and machine learning.

🛠️ Since 2016, I've delved into various problem domains, from Transportation Research to Pharmacogenomics and B2B2C logistics. Throughout my journey, I've worn many hats, including people manager, project manager, lead engineer, and mentor. This has given me the privilege of gaining a holistic perspective of the ever-evolving technology landscape and development lifecycle. 

🌟 Beyond my professional endeavors, I enjoy exploring new horizons through travel, embracing the great outdoors with hiking and mountain biking, and embarking on creative adventures by building full-stack web applications. You can catch me collaborating with my partner, @synesdeija, on these exciting projects. 🌄🚴‍♂️🌆
