# Welcome to my GitHub, folx! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I'm Andrew (he/they) 👨‍💻, a Senior Software Engineer and Architect who is passionate about building cutting-edge, distributed, scalable, and cloud-native data-intensive systems.

:rocket: Since 2016, I've delved into various problem domains, from Transportation Research to Pharmacogenomics and B2B2C logistics. Throughout this journey, I've had the privilege of wearing many hats, including: people manager, project manager, lead engineer, and mentor. This has allowed me to gain a holistic perspective of the ever-evolving technology landscape and development lifecycle.

🛠️ My technical depth spans a broad spectrum, encompassing Python, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Terraform, GCP, and AWS, to name a few. I've used these tools in web development, IoT, cloud computing, DevOps, and machine learning capacities.

🌟 Beyond my professional endeavors, I enjoy chasing the next big thing and playing Old School Runescape.
