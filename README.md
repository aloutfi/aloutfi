### Hello there, I'm Andrew (he/they) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer currently based in Columbia, Missouri, with specialization in python and *nix technologies. Iâ€™ve worked in web, IoT, cloud, DevOps, and Machine Learning problem domains. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making a blog on GitHub. I have a lot of opinions, and would like to share them. More to come on this soon. :wink: 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Google Cloud Platform and Kubernetes
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Learning more about Kubernetes
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Software Architecture is pretty interesting to me. That said, ask me about anything. Either I know the answer or I'll have a good idea about how to find it.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I graduated with a Master's in Software Engineering last May.
